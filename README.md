## About the Book
Machine learning is not just an advantage; it is becoming standard practice among top-performing trading firms. As traditional strategies struggle to navigate noise, complexity, and speed, ML-powered systems extract alpha by identifying transient patterns beyond human reach. This shift is transforming how hedge funds, quant teams, and algorithmic platforms operate, and now, these same capabilities are available to advanced practitioners.

This book is a practitioner’s blueprint for building production-grade ML trading systems from scratch. It goes far beyond basic return-sign classification tasks, which often fail in live markets, and delivers field-tested techniques used inside elite quant desks. It covers everything from the fundamentals of systematic trading and ML's role in detecting patterns to data preparation, backtesting, and model lifecycle management using Python libraries. You will learn to implement supervised learning for advanced feature engineering and sophisticated ML models. You will also learn to use unsupervised learning for pattern detection, apply ultra-fast pattern matching to chartist strategies, and extract crucial trading signals from unstructured news and financial reports. Finally, you will be able to implement anomaly detection and association rules for comprehensive insights. 

By the end of this book, you will be ready to design, test, and deploy intelligent trading strategies to institutional standards.
